Each creature in the cone must make a DC 15 constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 5d6 thunder damage and is deafened for 1 minute. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage and isn't deafened. Creatures and objects made of glass or crystal have disadvantage on the saving throw, and take 10d6 thunder damage instead of 5d6.",
