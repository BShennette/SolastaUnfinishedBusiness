Equipment/&Abjuration_MonasteryJournal_Content=It has now been one week since we were transported to this wretched place! I think the gods have abandoned us! Of our monastery, the only building missing is the temple and its two resident priests! In its place, we have this weird construction, just out of reach of the pier, which we can't even enter. \n\nAll the survivors are scared. They are turning to me for comforting words, but I am only a novice, not yet ready to be a priest. Like them, I am a refugee who fled Sorr-Tarr and his vile servant.\n\nI do not know where we are, but we are far from home. Our little valley is a small pocket of Tirmar, lost - I don't know where!
Equipment/&Abjuration_MonasteryJournal_Content2=Strange beasts roam the night, but for some reason they do not dare to enter our valley.\n\nI buried my daughter last night. She died as much from despair as from the rockslide and the earthquake. Now, I wait for my own end.\n\nTraveler - if you read this, say a prayer for our souls, for I cannot. I reject the gods whose folly brought us here! I curse them all!\n\nThe beasts have grown bolder, but they still avoid our valley. A pity, since I could use the meat. I am surviving on grain and vegetables, but solitude makes for hard labor and my strength is not what it was.
Equipment/&Abjuration_MonasteryJournal_Content3=It has been 40 years. I am the last one, an old man now! I buried them all - all! But I could not bring myself to give the last rites. No - the gods left us to rot here, and I refused to send our souls back to them!\n\nEmtan Darwaz, last of the Sandblaze Monastery

Equipment/&BoneKeep_Document_AdventurerJournal02_text3=I was right! We followed the sign and it seems to work - we're getting closer to the main stair. Today we found two new symbols and… Wait! I don't think we're alone in the maze. I can hear them coming towards me. We will move away from that room and try to hide until…
Equipment/&BoneKeep_Document_AdventurerJournal02_Title=Adventurer's Notes
Equipment/&BoneKeep_Document_AkshasJournal_Description=A locked book containing Aksha's notes since her arrival at the Keep.
Equipment/&BoneKeep_Document_AkshasJournal_text1=Lizzaria sent another party of her stupid zombies. One of them was an ogre, as if that would make things harder. Reek and Filth took care of it - I didn't even have to walk out. When will she understand that her attempts are useless? I'm getting tired of pretending to ignore who sends these monsters. I'm also getting tired of Mardracht. The old elf is powerful, for sure, but his mind is in decay. While he barricades himself in his solar, I've read all his damn books, but learned almost nothing.
Equipment/&BoneKeep_Document_AkshasJournal_text2=A Doom Gem. It took me forever to imbue it enough power to make it worthwhile. I still don't understand how the wizards of Manacalon could have done it in less than a year. Anyway, now I could use it to craft a nice weapon, but to what end? Killing Lizarria's zombies? I'm losing interest in the project now the difficult part is done. I don't need a magic dagger to make my enemies bleed.\n
Equipment/&BoneKeep_Document_AkshasJournal_text3=Reek is a good minion. He used to be handsome, but undeath doesn't suit him. Now he's just an obedient little pawn. Who would guess he was once a nobleman? I kept his armor and shield - he doesn't need them any more. Filth was always scum, but now at least she is of some use. She brings corpses to feed the ghouls, so I don't have to walk through piles of rotting fools. I'm thinking of creating another Brood, though. A nice, meaty Brood of Flesh would be nice. Maybe next month.

The war is not over, and we must also face these Manacalons.\nThey wield magic as potent as that of any priest, yet the High Priest assures us that there are no gods in this world.\nThese are dark times, and they will test us, but this world is our last hope.\nMay the Lord of Valor watch over you, my love.\nArtus

Of course, only Laerin has the magical knowledge to complete the… miracle. Arun pardon me for this word, but what this elvish magic can accomplish is simply god-like. \nAlas, our troops are massing to besiege the Rift and stop the enemy once and for all. I am ready for my first magical weapon, a gift for my Lady Karyn. She is already a formidable fighter, but with the blade Laerin will enchant, she will be even more so. \nI have collected various enchantments, and I am not sure yet which one will please her most.

Equipment/&HectorLetterContent1=It was a bad plan; I said so from the start. It took me a month to master Griff's full appearance and a year to build the spider cult. The orcs are now loyal to me and eager to follow me to war, but the Scavengers have found the city and started encroaching on the orcs' territory. I decided to use the orcs ahead of schedule and wipe out the Scavengers. There were only a dozen of them, but they put up more of a fight than I expected, and I had to change the plan again. I sacrificed more orcs to capture their leader, a man named Hector. I will cancel the operation with the spider cult, and take the appearance of this Hector. A prominent member of the Scavengers could be useful. I must spend time alone with him deeper in the ruins, where the orcs don't go.

The mission is a complete failure and I will answer to the Tshar - if I survive. I will try to escape by climbing up the amphitheater, but the spiders might be too fast for me. Glory to Sorr-Tarr!

Equipment/&Necromancy_AngbisJournal_Title=A handwritten, leather-bound book
Equipment/&Necromancy_AngbisJournal_Description=The Journal of Angbi Kramsson, of the Guild of Antiquarians.
Equipment/&Necromancy_AngbisJournal_Content01=If found, please return to the Guild of Antiquarians at Caer Cyflen. A reward will be offered.
Equipment/&Necromancy_AngbisJournal_Content02=Surroundings, continued …castle architecture is of First Expansion style, with many repairs and additions. A standard founding plaque: "Caer Tenarion", built by the 25th Iron Legion in the 24th year of Gwaltrian the Third - year 1557 in the Manacalon calendar, or 1486 before the Cataclysm. Presumably built to pacify the surrounding area.
Equipment/&Necromancy_AngbisJournal_Content03=Later, same day. My initial impression confirmed: the castle is occupied. I encountered a patrol of skeletons led by a wraith who gave his name as Adam the Twelfth, a former Imperial officer and now captain of the castle's guard. He questioned me closely and gave me permission to research outside the castle, but not to approach the castle or try to enter. The lord, whose name he gave as Mardracht, does not receive visitors. Indeed, the captain admitted that he himself had not seen or spoken with his master in several centuries.
Equipment/&Necromancy_AngbisJournal_Content04=Graveyard, continued …no gravestone shows a burial date later than the Cataclysm: no new burials in more than a thousand years. Possibly all in the castle are undead, like their guards. Impossible to confirm since I am refused admission.
Equipment/&Necromancy_AngbisJournal_Content05=Substantial mausoleum at far end of the cemetery, built in First Expansion style. Inscription over doorway names 25th Iron Legion. Presumably officers were buried inside (and possibly in catacombs beneath, if the building filled up over time) while lower ranks occupy the surrounding graveyard.
Equipment/&Necromancy_AngbisJournal_Content06=The following day, continued …as I continued to document the graveyard, a pack of wolves arrived from the north, led by a human man - or so he seemed. Met by captain and guards. Conversed for several minutes, manner guarded but not unfriendly. The captain pointed in my direction, clearly informing the man of my presence. No one in the group showed any interest in me.
Equipment/&Necromancy_AngbisJournal_Content07=Later, same day: An elven woman came out of the mausoleum, accompanied by several others: elves and humans, all apparently alive. They could not have entered the mausoleum without my seeing them. Two questions arise:
Equipment/&Necromancy_AngbisJournal_Content08=Another way into the mausoleum? Possible catacombs beneath - underground passage into the castle?
Equipment/&Necromancy_AngbisJournal_Content09=2. Living souls in the castle, yet no burials newer than 1,000 years? Two possibilities: life magically prolonged (necromancy? Fits with undead guard I encountered) and/or bodies not buried upon death (also compatible with necromancy).
Equipment/&Necromancy_AngbisJournal_Content10=I watched from hiding as they explored the graveyard, apparently looking for something (me?). Extreme caution is indicated from now on.
Equipment/&Necromancy_LizzariasJournal_Title=Lizzaria's Journal
Equipment/&Necromancy_LizzariasJournal_Description=A series of hand-written pages
Equipment/&Necromancy_LizzariasJournal_Content01=…upstairs to try to speak with Mardracht about it, but Aksha said he was resting and had left orders not to be disturbed - as usual. She offered to pass on a message - so helpful! - but I know it will never reach him.
Equipment/&Necromancy_LizzariasJournal_Content02=For all I know she's told him I'm dead. She may be planning to make it true. He's so shaken and addled from the Cataclysm, he'd probably believe her. She could have killed him already - he could have been dead for centuries - but no: his magical defenses are still in place. He must be alive.
Equipment/&Necromancy_LizzariasJournal_Content03=If only I could reach him - free him from her influence - but I can't get past her and her ghouls. So frustrating! I need to arrange a sudden meeting with a wooden stake, but she's careful.
Equipment/&Necromancy_LizzariasJournal_Content04=Adam's no help. He won't join me against Aksha without orders from Mardracht, which of course can't come because she's got him isolated. How blind is he not to see that - I'll never yield the castle to her, no matter what she does. While Mardracht lives, I have to keep trying to save him.
Equipment/&Necromancy_LizzariasJournal_Content05=…searching the graveyard as usual. The dwarf was there - he always thought I didn't see him, but I did - but now he's a ghost. Adam said he was an Antiquarian, some sort of scholar, so I tried to control him and find out what he knows.
Equipment/&Necromancy_LizzariasJournal_Content06=I was over-eager, though, and he got away. An opportunity lost. He might know something that could help me get past Aksha and her ghouls and free Mardracht from her influence. Someday, somehow, I will get rid of her. I will.

This old worm has a few tricks yet - oh, yes. We were as powerful as gods ourselves, once. The elves have forgotten, but once they knew. Yes, they did.
Equipment/&Necromancy_MardrachtsJournal_Content04=Why don't they come? Have these alien gods been destroyed already? Is it safe outside? Or is that what they want me to think? They won't lure me out - oh, no. Never.

Equipment/&Necromancy_Thesis_Title=On the New Magic of Humans and Their Gods
Equipment/&Necromancy_Thesis_Description=An ancient-looking book, with the eight rings of the Arcaneum embossed into the cover. 
Equipment/&Necromancy_Thesis_Content01=On the New Magic of Humans and Their Gods, and Its Particular Implications for Necromancy. By Alithariel Threanin, Postulant Junior Master of the Arcaneum, School of Necromancy. Academic Session of 3044, Imperial Calendar
Equipment/&Necromancy_Thesis_Content02=As my thesis in support of my candidacy for the rank of Junior Master of the Arcaneum at the School of Necromancy, I respectfully submit the results of my research into the nature and types of new magics brought to Solasta by the humans of Tirmar, in particular the effectiveness of those whom they call "clerics" in repelling and destroying undead creatures. This knowledge is of urgent importance as we struggle to understand these humans, and assess both the severity of the threat they may post to the Empire and the potential benefit they could bring to it once conquered.
Equipment/&Necromancy_Thesis_Content03=It is widely known that the magic of humans derives from the entities they call "gods" ("goddesses" in the feminine, and "deities" collectively). I call it "divine magic" in this thesis, to distinguish it from our own arcane magic that is the result of magical study. Just as arcane magic is organized into schools, some divine magic is comprised of eight areas of study, which the humans call "domains." Each deity typically provides its clerics with access to two domains, representing its particular interests. The domain that corresponds most closely to the School of Necromancy is called the Domain of Oblivion.
Equipment/&Necromancy_Thesis_Content04=In addition to spells from two domains, a cleric has access to a wide array of other spells and powers, which are common to all regardless of their patron deity. Many are broadly similar in their effects to the spells of the School of Necromancy. There are two necromantic powers, though, that are completely new and unique: a cleric of any Tirmarian deity, if their rank is high enough, can repel undead creatures and even destroy them. The humans I have questioned believe that this is because their deities regard all undead creatures as "unnatural" - a word that reveals much about their primitive level of sophistication - and therefore undesirable, but they seem to know nothing about the means by which this result is achieved, speaking only about the "will" or "power" of their deities.
Equipment/&Necromancy_Thesis_Content05=The following pages examine the phenomenon of "turning" and destroying undead using both the classical thaumatological approach of Fathirien and her successors, and the more modern methods championed by Gorlindrien and the Practicalists. All conclusions are tentative. If this thesis is accepted, I propose to make this phenomenon my primary research topic.
Equipment/&Necromancy_Fallen_Title=Torn Page
Equipment/&Necromancy_Fallen_Description=A page apparently torn from a book, crumpled and thrown on the floor.
Equipment/&Necromancy_Fallen_Content01=…as the Soraks followed humanity, a high priest of Oblivion succumbed to despair and madness. He tainted the peace of the grave with the uncleanliness of undeath, raising the fallen to muster an army. As he knew this was not a prayer that would gain the favor of Maraike, the lady of life and death, he and his followers couched their plan in the form of a curse instead, tricking their goddess into ensuring that their plan would succeed. Maraike granted their plea, but was not deceived. She cursed the conspirators as well, for they had been corrupted by evil and were denied her grace. They became the fallen, and those they raised from death became sorrow zombies, named after the curse of sorrow that they had wrought.
Equipment/&Necromancy_Fallen_Content02=Maraike's punishment ensured that none of the fallen could enjoy the touch of light without suffering and dying. They must forever skulk in the shadows until they repented. But Maraike's punishment was not all. Sorr-Tarr, the vile god of the Soraks, saw potential in the fallen. Without undoing Maraike's curse, he gave them powers to do evil: to corrupt others by their touch, and to create fouler servants than zombies. Of the original fallen not much is known, save that there were twelve of them, priests and paladins…
Equipment/&Necromancy_Refugees_Title=Torn Page
Equipment/&Necromancy_Refugees_Description=A page apparently torn from a book, crumpled and thrown on the floor.
Equipment/&Necromancy_Refugees_Content01=…the humans explained that they had fled to Solasta from their home, a world they called Tirmar, and that they were pursued by a race they called Sorr-Akkath or Soraks, which had spread across this world of Tirmar, and threatened to conquer all others.
Equipment/&Necromancy_Refugees_Content02=The Governor received them with the appearance of kindness, reasoning that if they came as supplicant fugitives it would be an easy task to subdue them, and either set them to work as slaves alongside the inferior races of Solasta or bind them over to the wizards of the Arcaneum for dissection or whatever other form of study might prove most fruitful. When the guards sought to bind the humans, though, they called upon beings they called "gods," and manifested powerful magics that took their hosts by surprise. Thus they were able to escape.
Equipment/&Necromancy_Gods_Title=Torn Page
Equipment/&Necromancy_Gods_Description=A page apparently torn from a book, crumpled and thrown on the floor.
Equipment/&Necromancy_Gods_Content01=…deities of Tirmar are a source of a new and unknown kind of magic. The humans believe they are powerful entities, perhaps extraplanar in nature, whom they worship and whose commands they follow, receiving power in return.
Equipment/&Necromancy_Gods_Content02=The humans are careful to distinguish between "good" and "evil" deities. "Good" deities are those whom the humans see as helpful to them, and - in their theology at least - concerned with their welfare. "Evil" deities are those who are hostile to humans and support the efforts of other races to conquer them. It was an "evil" deity and his followers - one Sorr-Tarr and the race of the Sorr-Akkath, or Soraks - who drove the humans to try to escape their home world of Tirmar, they say. Their arrival on Solasta…
Equipment/&Abjuration_Dragons_Title=The Time of the Dragons
Equipment/&Abjuration_Dragons_Description=An old book with the image of a dragon embossed on the cover.
Equipment/&Abjuration_Dragons_Content01=There was a time, very long ago, when dragons were the rulers of Solasta. They lived in the mountains, close to volcanoes which they loved for their heat - for nothing else was hot enough to incubate a dragon's egg. At that time the dwarves had not yet come up from below ground, being more rock than flesh, and the halflings remained in their swamps, far from anyone. And what of the elves? The elves were in and of the air, without physical form but existing as swirling currents of air and mana, one with magic and with the world.
Equipment/&Abjuration_Dragons_Content02=Eventually, however, the elves tired of a life of pure spirit and wind. They took a physical form and began to build great spires and palaces, bringing the beauty of their thoughts into material being. The dragons feared them, and a great war ensued, pitting fire and magic against air and magic until the elves…
Equipment/&Abjuration_Housekeeping_Title=The Good Management of Servants
Equipment/&Abjuration_Housekeeping_Description=An old book that seems to have been well-thumbed.
Equipment/&Abjuration_Housekeeping_Content01=The supreme duty of the head of a household is the management of servants. This is more important even than the welfare of the family, because a household can survive internal strife and injustice, but it cannot survive a breakdown in discipline. Heed well the lessons of history, and keep thoughts of revolt from the minds of your slaves.
Equipment/&Abjuration_Housekeeping_Content02=Remember that no matter how intelligent and endearing they may seem, your non-elf slaves are animals, nothing more. Do not indulge them, but give them every day a new reason to fear your wrath and a fresh reminder that your power is absolute. It is not going too far, if you can afford it, to select one at random now and again for death by torture. As well as providing entertainment for your guests and an example for your children, this practice instils a healthy…

Equipment/&Abjuration_DragonsWar_Content01=The dragons saw how the elves were changing the world, bringing beauty to blasted volcanic wastes, and living green to barren fields of rock.

Equipment/&Abjuration_DragonsWar_Content02=The dragons fell in love with the elves, as all do who see them. They longed to possess them, for dragons are avaricious by nature. With sweet words and trickery they enslaved a few of the fair people, but most elves were not taken in by the dragons' flattery, and prepared to resist them.
Equipment/&Abjuration_DragonsWar_Content03=Great battles were fought, blade against flame, and magic against magic. Mountains were leveled, and land sank to make the Inner Sea. The tunnels where the dwarves hid in fear were flooded. It was in that bloody crucible that our people's mastery of magic was forged, and the elven race united under the first Emperor Ilmathir Ellanion.
Equipment/&Abjuration_DragonsWar_Content04=The war against the dragons lasted for three generations before the Warrior Empress Cythaeriel Ellanion, the Lady of the Bright Blade, led the elves to…

Equipment/&Illusion_Book1_Title=Illusion and Substance: A Primer
Equipment/&Illusion_Book1_Description=A book written in high elvish.
Equipment/&Illusion_Book1_Content01=…as Master Irillien of the Arcaneum wrote in his great work "On the Nature of Illusion and the Question of Reality," "Many illusions, if believed, are as effective as if they were real; conversely, some realities, if ignored, may be avoided. Which, then, is more valid? What, indeed, is real, or reality? Was our great Empire, and our rightful mastery of the world and all who dwell therein, not a dream, which is a form of illusion, before our Iron Legions and our arcanists made it real?"
Equipment/&Illusion_Book1_Content02=There is some merit, therefore, in avoiding a distinction between illusion and reality, but regarding them instead as two poles of a continuum. Some things are entirely real, and some things are entirely illusory, but the numbers of each are far fewer than is commonly supposed. Most things lie somewhere in between, partaking of the natures of illusion and reality in differing proportions. Those who seek a true understanding of the nature of things, and the distinctions…
Equipment/&Illusion_Book2_Title=Human Gods and Their Magic
Equipment/&Illusion_Book2_Description=A book written in high elvish.
Equipment/&Illusion_Book2_Content01=…exploration of the planes outside our own revealed the existence of all manner of strange entities, some of them exceptionally powerful. It is to be supposed that the world of Tirmar, from which the humans came with their gods, belongs in one of these planes, which somehow collided with our own during the events leading up to the Cataclysm, instead of remaining safely confined beyond a magical portal.
Equipment/&Illusion_Book2_Content02=The reason for this is unknown. Several theories have been put forward, but none has been proven. Although they vary in their finer details, many theories blame the deity Sorr-Tarr, from whom the humans and their gods were fleeing as they entered Solasta. The scholars of the Arcaneum do not fully understand the class of beings called "gods" or "deities," and while their human followers proudly assert that their powers are without limit, it is clear that this cannot be the case, or the Cataclysm would have been prevented. Still, this Sorr-Tarr, being a powerful entity of this class, might have sought to open the Rift wider, in order to facilitate the pursuit by his Sorr-Akkath followers and complete…
Equipment/&Illusion_Book3_Title=On Those Who Came from Tirmar
Equipment/&Illusion_Book3_Description=A book written in high elvish.
Equipment/&Illusion_Book3_Content01=…humans and Sorr-Akkath are thought to be the only mortal beings to cross from Tirmar, the question of orcs and their kin must be taken into account. Human accounts of the matter are confused and often contradict each other, but a careful reading of the best sources suggests that the orcs were once human, and were altered by the wild magics that accompanied the closing of the Rift.
Equipment/&Illusion_Book3_Content02=The human ancestors of the orcs were members of wild barbarian tribes from the more remote parts of Tirmar. Ferocity and courage in battle were the highest values in their culture, so when the forces of our two worlds combined at the Battle of the Rift, it was these tribes who sought out the most dangerous locations in order to win the most glory by the values of their culture. This brought them very close to the Rift itself, and therefore made them most vulnerable to the unpredictable magical energies that flared out from it. All of those who fought beside them perished, even the elite of the Iron Legions - but somehow these barbarians, strong of mind and strong of body, were able to survive. However, their bodies and minds were both affected, and they became the first orcs to exist in both worlds.

Equipment/&DLC1_Equipment_Document_ForgeCaptureGiantHasdrubalOrders_Description=Giants are too powerful to be left wandering around, and besides, this one knows the location of our camp. Capture the creature and keep it in chains until further notice.
Equipment/&DLC1_Equipment_Document_ForgeDryadThreatReport_Title=Tree of Death
Equipment/&DLC1_Equipment_Document_ForgeDryadThreatReport_Description=Hasdrubal: \n While on patrol, Garral camped near the big tree with his troops. In the morning, everyone was dead except one sentry who neither saw nor heard anything. \n We just had word from some merchants who had set up camp near the same tree, and their sentry tells an identical tale. \n Also, one of our patrols found the corpses of several troops in the livery of Orenetis not far from this same tree. While our troops shed no tears over their fate, concern is spreading about this tree. I strongly recommend that some action be taken. We've chased dryads away from that tree. Maybe it's them, somehow, retaliating.
Equipment/&DLC1_Equipment_Document_ForgeOrcSwampBaseReport_Title=A Heavy Raid
Equipment/&DLC1_Equipment_Document_ForgeOrcSwampBaseReport_Description=Hasdrubal: \n One of our patrols reports that an orc raiding party has settled in the old fort: you know the one. They are using it as a base to raid through the swamp as well as to strike at targets nearer the city, which, of course, brings unwanted attention in our direction. Please send someone to convince them to move away.
Equipment/&DLC1_Equipment_Document_ForgeWanderingElfReport_Title=Lonely Traveler
Equipment/&DLC1_Equipment_Document_ForgeWanderingElfReport_Description=Hasdrubal: \n Some of our scouts spotted a solitary elf traveling alone. From his gear, he looks to be a mage, but his purpose is unclear. A spy? Someone sent to the swamps as a punishment? I suggest someone make contact and talk to him, but this should be done far away from the camp.
Equipment/&DLC1_Equipment_Document_ForgeRebelMeetingReport_Title=Trouble with the Rebels
Equipment/&DLC1_Equipment_Document_ForgeRebelMeetingReport_Description=Hasdrubal: \n I think it is time you involved yourself directly in our meetings.

Equipment/&DLC1_Equipment_Document_ForgeReportUndead_Description=Hasdrubal: \n A patrol reports undead activity near the old bridge. This is new as the area was quiet before. We should investigate. Perhaps some idiot opened an opulent tomb, and we only need to find the entrance. \n I just hope it isn't some hidden necropolis with scores and scores of undead inside. That would force us to redirect resources from many operations until we are able to resolve the issue.
Equipment/&DLC1_Equipment_Document_ForgeReportTrolls_Title=Tunnel and Trolls!
Equipment/&DLC1_Equipment_Document_ForgeReportTrolls_Description=Hasdrubal: \n During our last patrol, we spotted some trolls entering the big caves. They were too many for us to fight, so we waited and watched. They seem ready to settle down there, and one of my scouts swears there were some young trolls among them. As the caves are near one of our main routes, this spells trouble. Please send reinforcements immediately - and make sure they bring lots of torches and oil. We'll need them!

Equipment/&DLC1_Equipment_Document_OrenetisDraconicStudy_Title=Polymorphing Report
Equipment/&DLC1_Equipment_Document_OrenetisDraconicStudy_Description=The problem isn't physical. As far as we can tell, our Lord Protector is healthy. That he can't revert to his higher form…\n  …can only mean that there is one fundamental aspect of the process that we fail to grasp. \n Therefore, we must continue to experiment on the most diverse array of subjects possible, morphing animals and even those ridiculous pets that druids dare to call kindred spirits. In these links and experiments, we shall find the key to free our Lord.

Equipment/&DLC1_Equipment_Document_HybridTestReport01_Description=The changes we wrought on the dire wolves enhanced their aggression and ferocity. They look ugly and their stench can be overwhelming, but when we pitted them against unaltered pure breeds of their kind, there wasn't even a contest. The second test involved armed runaway rebels, who were also slaughtered with ease. All in all, the program is delivering on its initial promise. The next step will be to ensure that the mutations carry over to the next generation.

Equipment/&DLC1_Equipment_Document_HybridTestReport02_Description=My Lord: \n As you know, our work with the bears has been very successful. Their ferocity and strength are unrivaled. They are truly fearsome. But there is better news yet. Last night, one of our bears gave birth to two healthy cubs, showing all the signs of our work. We have made the changes hereditary! However, the ferocity of the species is such that the young did not survive long, as their first mewling caused their enraged father to kill them.
Equipment/&DLC1_Equipment_Document_HybridTestReport03_Title=Hybrid Bulette - Progress Report, Phase Two
Equipment/&DLC1_Equipment_Document_HybridTestReport03_Description=My Lord: \n Phase two of testing is complete. The bulette shows much promise: its carapace is harder, its enhanced muscles give it added jumping capabilities, and its jaw can even crush rocks. To proceed with phase three of testing, we will need worthwhile adversaries to push it to its limits and prove the success of the work so far.
Equipment/&DLC1_Equipment_Document_ResearchReportOnSitenero_Title=Special Guest - Monthly Report
Equipment/&DLC1_Equipment_Document_ResearchReportOnSitenero_Description=To our Lord Protector, Orenetis the Benevolent: \n My Lord, the behavior of our guest follows its usual patterns: long periods of contemplation, some calisthenics, and not much in the way of conversation. Somewhat unusually, there was no attempt at bribery during this observation period. I might hope that he has learned better than to try it, but I suspect he plans to lull us into relaxing our guard. Not that we would do that after the mishap twenty years ago. The fate of that set of guards was a stark reminder of the price of shirking one's duty.

Equipment/&DLC3_Telema_SessrothReport_Title=Report of Interplanar Experiments
Equipment/&DLC3_Telema_SessrothReport_Description=This book is entirely written in the draconic language. It contains illustrations of monstrous creatures with horns, wings, and fangs.
Equipment/&DLC3_Telema_SessrothReport_Content01=My work on Gates has led me to an intriguing proposition. If my calculations are correct, the Gates function by creating a path between two points, passing through another dimension. In so doing, they create a path that is shorter than one that remains entirely within our own. If there are dimensions - or planes, or universes, call them what you will - other than our own, it follows that there may be worlds in those dimensions, and inhabitants of those worlds, and who knows what other discoveries waiting to be made? I must investigate this further.
Equipment/&DLC3_Telema_SessrothReport_Content02=Initial work on the planar travel project - as I have decided to call it - has been slow and frustrating. There are intricacies to the tuning of dimensional harmonics which go far beyond those for travel across Solasta that have required me to create an entirely new branch of mathematics. In addition, the mana requirements are exponentially larger, and have led to some unfortunate effects in the mile or so around my experimental Gate - fortunately, these were fairly easy to contain.
Equipment/&DLC3_Telema_SessrothReport_Content03=More difficult were the identification and acquisition of sufficiently robust materials for the vital components of the modified Gate. These became necessary after early experiments left entire assemblies melted or even vaporized. A rare metal from the northern mountains shows promise, although a dragon is unlikely to be welcome there. I am practicing with a halfling polymorph persona, and am hopeful of obtaining what I need through this subterfuge.
Equipment/&DLC3_Telema_SessrothReport_Content04=My Major Gate experiments have borne fruit at last. After several failed attempts took me all across the face of Solasta, I at last reached a completely new location. At first, I thought I had landed in the far north of Ferendragh, for my surroundings were cold and icy. However, the architecture of the ice-cut palace in which I found myself was not Manacalon, nor in the style of the Snow Alliance, and the creatures I encountered were as far from Snow Dwarves as I could imagine. I soon realized that I had stumbled upon a place of evil, full of vile creatures hungry for chaos and destruction. They call themselves demons.
Equipment/&DLC3_Telema_SessrothReport_Content05=Though most of the denizens of this ice palace were no match for a Manacalon dragon, their ruler was another matter entirely. I had already learned that this creature's name was Sessroth and that it went under a variety of epithets and sobriquets, each more violent than the last. In truth, I found all of them to be well deserved, for I was hard pressed to return to Solasta and write this report. Alas, I soon realized I had been followed by Sessroth through a hole left in the interplanar fabric, a hole I myself had made. When demons started flowing through, I had no choice but to call upon my sister Adrasteia, for she is the master of Abjuration.
Equipment/&DLC3_Telema_SessrothReport_Content06=Together, we fought Sessroth and gravely wounded him, tearing apart one of his arms, but at the moment that death struck him, he was gated back to his own plane. We pursued him only to find him sat on the throne of his Palace of Ice, regenerated and surrounded by many powerful allies. Adrasteia improvised a spell to seclude them in the palace. We returned home, exhausted. In the meantime, demons had ravaged many villages of the Snow Alliance and been defeated at great cost, leaving a trail of grief and despair among the people who had so kindly helped me gather precious metal for my experiments.
Equipment/&DLC3_Telema_SessrothReport_Content07=Adrasteia told me her spell could never hold against the power of so many demons, unless a constant effort and flow of mana was maintained. She had used Sessroth's bone to link the spell to the Archreaver, forbidding him above all to gate to Solasta, but she needed a sacrifice from me too, one that I was only too willing to make since I had been the cause of the situation. I offered up five of my claws so that I would be forever linked to the spell myself.
Equipment/&DLC3_Telema_SessrothReport_Content08=In addition, to prevent an invasion in the unforeseeable future, the spell needed more strength. Under the cover of my halfling wizard persona, I explained to the lords of the Snow Alliance that they too needed to give up something of themselves to protect their land against the demons. Five clan leaders agreed to swear an oath to maintain the spell, each bearing one of my claws to draw from their lifeforce, to keep the Palace of Ice on its plane and prevent interplanar travel to Solasta. The damage done by a handful of greater demons was enough for them to accept and take the oath, forming the Pact of the Claw.
Equipment/&DLC3_Telema_SessrothReport_Content09=They have pledged on their honor that the barriers will be maintained, and that the responsibility for doing so will be passed down to their heirs and successors forever. The fact of a passage to another plane is to be kept a closely guarded secret, for fear of inciting the curiosity of others like me who might be tempted to open the way and doom our whole world in doing so. Though not all the peoples of the Snow Alliance are of dwarven stock, all share, more or less, in the dwarven sense of honor, and I am satisfied that they and their descendants will keep their word.
Equipment/&DLC3_Telema_SessrothReport_Content10=I shall now exercise greater care, and step away from further interplanar travels. As per my sister's request, I will return to Telema with my experimental Gate and begin teaching the new generation of elves.

Bullshit!\nI understand the commercial reasoning, but Valdi has put the Alliance at risk. Especially as those Gallivan emissaries acted so strangely. Am I the only one who noticed? Maybe I should talk to Alvig? I know I can trust him. \n The return trip went well, but I wonder why some of them came with us…\n\n And now, the well has collapsed.

Equipment/&DLC3_Investigation_Item_Undermountain_03_Content=26-3-1026\n Dear Priniwyn,\n This is my first time in Turvaamalinn, and I must say I was impressed by the size of the city. The crossing of the mountain was hard, but the hope of finding you took the pressure off my legs. And what about the view once up there! I arrived just before the storm hit. Master Goldentongue's caravan didn't drag on; you can tell they are used to these conditions. But here I am, in town. I hope to be able to hold you in a short while.
Equipment/&DLC3_Investigation_Item_Undermountain_03B_Content=8-4-1026\n Dear Luriviel,\n I treasure the memory of our reunion. You are incredible! Thank you for being the way you are and for sharing that with me. I will soon leave on a new mission and be gone for a few weeks; I don't exactly know where yet. This is the first time a destination hasn't been given! But it will be in the southeast of the Snow Alliance, so no hope of me passing near your colonies.

We went all the way there to… find a deal on the price of Gallivan vegetables! \n Well, anyway, we're back with more than we left with. Everything is fine, but poor Berghild looks exhausted from the trip. I think she's worried, but I'm not sure why. You met her last time, I think. She's a good person, I'll talk to her soon.\nI can't wait to see you again.

Equipment/&AbyssalAgitatorInstructionsContent01=An unintended boon discovered in my myriad encounters with demon-kind has been that the essences of their spirit and mana are often left behind as a viscous substance once their host is killed.

Equipment/&DLC3_Einareum_Lore_SnowAlliance_Content02=Having spent years trading with the people of the Snow Alliance, I have found there are a few things one ought to know if one wishes to understand both them and their culture.

Equipment/&DLC3_WhiteCity_Lore_GuideCity_Title=A Guide to White Rock City
Equipment/&DLC3_WhiteCity_Lore_GuideCity_Description=How White Rock City is organized and how it was constructed.
Equipment/&DLC3_WhiteCity_Lore_GuideCity_Content01=The roots of our mountains run deep, but none deeper or as wide as blessed Valkarokkopun, known in the common tongue as "White Rock City." Although our ancient metropolis has a history lost in time, we know that the Manacalon elves had yet to defeat the dragon menace when we mined the first of the finest marbles, granites, and fabulous quartz of rarest quality from the mountain's veins.\n When the Manacalon Empire first attacked us, the Clan Kaakkoinen were already constructing fortifications.
Equipment/&DLC3_WhiteCity_Lore_GuideCity_Content02=Valkarokkopun was by then a large city fueled by the discovery of veins of almost pure gold, silver, and flawless precious gems, positioned on a strategic pass linking the southern lands with the endless Great White to the north. The city not only expanded down through the mountain, using marvels of our dwarf engineering that include complex elevators, ventilation, and heating, but also out to the north and south, with substantial fortified areas in concentric rings.
Equipment/&DLC3_WhiteCity_Lore_GuideCity_Content03=Since then, the Kaakkoinen, now known in the common tongue as the Kaikonnen, have built ever larger, more complex fortifications and many technological marvels within. This impeccable dwarfish foresight has allowed us snow dwarves and our allies in the Snow Alliance to protect our ever growing wealth from outsiders, as we mine the fabulous mountain depths.
Equipment/&DLC3_WhiteCity_Lore_MasgarthEvents_Title=A Chronicle of Events in Masgarth
Equipment/&DLC3_WhiteCity_Lore_MasgarthEvents_Description=A dwarf-eye view of recent historic events.
Equipment/&DLC3_WhiteCity_Lore_MasgarthEvents_Content01=Blood and stone! \n When first I heard this tale from Masgarth, I was much disposed to be doubtful of the events that I record here. But now having discussed them with those Antiquarians present at Caer Cyflen, I must admit to sharing no small sense of wonder. And why, you may ask? \n It appears we have now roaming Ferendragh, mighty folk who show the insight, cunning, and dogged determination one would normally expect of folk from the Snow Alliance!
Equipment/&DLC3_WhiteCity_Lore_MasgarthEvents_Content02=Four brave adventurers, first deputized to the Legacy Council, and now Heroes of Masgarth. \n As we all know, Princess Ceiwad Silverflower hasn't seemed most focused when discussing matters of import, despite her good intentions. So, it was with much surprise that her hiring of four deputies brought the most astounding destruction of a devious plot to infiltrate and overthrow the Principality. A plot by the Sorr-Akkath, a force of legendary evil that, it turns out, was real!
Equipment/&DLC3_WhiteCity_Lore_MasgarthEvents_Content03=It turns out these Sorr-Akkath were lurking in the ruins and wastes of the Badlands, and had begun to spread east, hiding in shadows, plotting to defile and destroy all that is good in the world. I have no doubt that there are nefarious folk among the New Empire and Gallivan that are to blame. We know how much they covet the lands of Masgarth. Filthy southerners.\n But I digress. Allow me to continue with my tale…
Equipment/&DLC3_WhiteCity_Lore_MasgarthEvents_Content04=This volume continues to tell a sometimes wildly inaccurate tale of the Heroes of Solasta.
Equipment/&DLC3_WhiteCity_Lore_HumanClans_Title=The Itainen Vartmerkint
Equipment/&DLC3_WhiteCity_Lore_HumanClans_Description=A book of the Eastern Clans of the Snow Alliance.
Equipment/&DLC3_WhiteCity_Lore_HumanClans_Content01=When we arrived here in the lands of the Snow Alliance, we were homeless and lost. Strangers shipwrecked and washed up on the shores of a strange world. But the dwarves and elves of the Snow Alliance saw that we were indomitable, trustworthy, and - most importantly - skilled. When the mana drained from the world during the Cataclysm, those skills became a lifeline that none could live without. A binding force that held us together.
Equipment/&DLC3_WhiteCity_Lore_HumanClans_Content02=By the end of the War of Sorrow, we had become the Eastern Guardians, the "Itainen Vartmerkint." \n Among the clans in the roll call of the Most Honored, we have cast our own names in the forges of War and Survival. Here stand some of those of deserved recognition:\n The Blunts: A military family with a glorious past all the way up to the present.\n The Ashdowns: An honorable family, true to the Snow Alliance.\n The Sledges: A merchant family of great wealth and culture.\n The Rivers: Faithful and brave.
Equipment/&DLC3_WhiteCity_Lore_HumanClans_Content03=How many more will add their names to the list of the Most Honored? Only time will tell.
Equipment/&DLC3_WhiteCity_Lore_NorthernClans_Title=The Pohjolen Vartmerkint
Equipment/&DLC3_WhiteCity_Lore_NorthernClans_Description=A short history of the Northern Guardians.
Equipment/&DLC3_WhiteCity_Lore_NorthernClans_Content01=Ice and fire. When writing of the great houses of the Northern Guardians, it must be noted that life in the Great White is extreme, harsh, and demanding. Life, even for snow dwarves of the hardiest disposition, is too often cut short by adverse conditions and the many terrifyingly dangerous creatures that inhabit these snowy wastes. It is for this reason that those who make a life in the Great White stay loyal and true to friends, neighbors, and allies.
Equipment/&DLC3_WhiteCity_Lore_NorthernClans_Content02=Such steadfast character creates many leaders and persons of great note, bravery, and wisdom; among them:\n Hakki Goldheart - Clan chief of the Pohjolen Vartmerkint, killer of remorhaz\n Glodi Strongheart - Brave warrior and battle leader\n Jarnhilde Wisetongue - Warrior and representative of the Pohjolen\nHjalmar Whitecloud - storm giant friend, and killer of hill giants\n The list is ever growing and illustrious.
Equipment/&DLC3_WhiteCity_Lore_ElvenClans_Title=The Lantinen Vartmerkint
Equipment/&DLC3_WhiteCity_Lore_ElvenClans_Description=The Western Clans and Houses of the Snow Alliance.
Equipment/&DLC3_WhiteCity_Lore_ElvenClans_Content01=Dear reader, please find herein a brief record of the Lantinen Vartmerkint and its current main contributors. \n We, the Lantinen, are a loose confederation of noble houses and clans that have existed for millennia, since before even the Snow Alliance. Many of our members, who founded the Western Guardians, are made up of the descendants of the high elves and sylvan elves that first fled the brutal tyranny of the Manacalon Empire several thousand years before the Cataclysm.
Equipment/&DLC3_WhiteCity_Lore_ElvenClans_Content02=Our self-reliant skills, hard-fought-for knowledge, and bravery have kept our lands, and latterly the lands of our allies in the Snow Alliance, free from oppression and evil since our first arrival. It is therefore with great pride that we acknowledge the deep regard in which we are held by our dwarven, gnomish, and recent human friends, and take great joy in calling them our friends. \n Those that are held in highest regard are listed below:
Equipment/&DLC3_WhiteCity_Lore_ElvenClans_Content03=Elder Estorgath Sharpmind - Eldest and wisest among us. Keeper of our Lore and Singer of Songs.\n Kelariel Brightsong - Bard of the College of Hope\nEsgariel Goldenhawk - Almost legendary, a lone Ranger of the Wilds. Esgariel has been unseen and unheard from in the last century. Some say she must be dead, but she has also been known to disappear for long periods several times in the last six hundred years.
Equipment/&DLC3_WhiteCity_Lore_ElvenClans_Content04=Lutharion Quicklimb - A Greenmage hermit who spends most of his time roaming the western Snow Alliance, giving aid to communities and eliminating monstrous threats…
Equipment/&DLC3_WhiteCity_Lore_ElvenClans_Content05=This book continues at length to detail the names and many locations of various noble houses and clans.
Equipment/&DLC3_WhiteCity_Lore_SnowAlliance_Title=The Snow Alliance: A History
Equipment/&DLC3_WhiteCity_Lore_SnowAlliance_Description=How the Snow Alliance formed and the clans who forged it.
Equipment/&DLC3_WhiteCity_Lore_SnowAlliance_Content01=In those early days of its foundation, our brave dwarvish houses each took responsibility for the defense of an entry point of the early settlements in the valleys and mines of White Rock. We called these alliances "Vartmerkint," which translates loosely from the old dwarvish as "Guardians of the Entries," each group competing to outdo all the others in feats of engineering and martial prowess. As our lands expanded, other new clans and Vartmerkint were formed as was necessary and practical.
Equipment/&DLC3_WhiteCity_Lore_SnowAlliance_Content02=The history of the Snow Alliance is a many splendored tale of victory through millennia of hardships and adversity, forged in centuries of struggle and wars against the elements, the monstrous inhabitants of the region, the predations of the Manacalon Empire, the chaotic and catastrophic opening of the Rift, the equally traumatic Cataclysm, the War of Sorrow, and later wars.\n The earliest Vartmerkint recorded were among the indigenous Snow Dwarves in and around Valkarokkopun (White Rock City).
Equipment/&DLC3_WhiteCity_Lore_SnowAlliance_Content03=Soon these "Vartmerkint" or "Guardians", by dwarvish tradition, were named after the points of the compass. \n Namely: \n the Eastern - "Itainen"\nthe Western - "Lantinen"\n the Northern - "Pohjolen" \n and the Southern Guardians - "Ettilen Vartmerkint". \n Then there were the "deep dwarves" who guarded the mines and tunnels below the mountains, who became known as the Central Guardians - "Keskainen Vartmerkint"\n And so were formed the leading clans we know to this day. But no land is impervious to change.
Equipment/&DLC3_WhiteCity_Lore_SnowAlliance_Content04=Over time this group of clans became the Snow Alliance, but as the ravages of the wars with Manacalon, the Cataclysm, and the War of Sorrows took their toll, we were left no choice but to seek help from those that lived around us in the mountains, forests, and valleys. \n First were the sylvan elves who had fled the first formation and expansion of the Manacalon Empire, settling in the western forests. Their cunning and bravery, uncomplaining, won them our trust and first entry to the Alliance.
Equipment/&DLC3_WhiteCity_Lore_SnowAlliance_Content05=And then, after the near destruction of the first Lantinen in the Cataclysm, we passed that banner to them. \n Next came the fall of the first Itainen, utterly destroyed in the War of Sorrows. The Snow Alliance was on its knees, but the humans that had come through the Rift never once shirked their duty; always guarding, always fighting, always working to help anyone in need. Using all of their alien knowledge and skills to keep the Alliance safe from any threat, becoming the second Itainen.
Equipment/&DLC3_WhiteCity_Lore_SnowAlliance_Content06=And so the Snow Alliance now stands proud, all 200 clans, with five pre-eminent; the Itainen, Lantinen, Pohjolen, Ettilen, and Keskainen. These five are now known as the "Pact of the Claw," why the name…
Equipment/&DLC3_WhiteCity_Lore_SnowAlliance_Content07=Someone seems to have torn out a large number of pages here.
Equipment/&DLC3_Undermountain_Lore_MilitaryRanks_Title=Turvaamalinn Military Ranks
Equipment/&DLC3_Undermountain_Lore_MilitaryRanks_Description=A brief discussion of dwarven military ranks.
Equipment/&DLC3_Undermountain_Lore_MilitaryRanks_Content01=The ranks of the army of Turvaamalinn are as solid and noble in character as the soldiers who stand in defense of the Undermountain. It is therefore of no great surprise that we organize and name those ranks according to the traditional dwarven assay values of metallic ores, and then combine those with the old dwarvish title "Jakar," meaning "Hunter" or "Warrior":\nThus the lowest ranking of our soldiers are known as "Pronsjakar" or "Bronze Hunters."
Equipment/&DLC3_Undermountain_Lore_MilitaryRanks_Content02=next are the "Hopajakar" or "Silver Hunters," and then highest ranked, the "Kultajakar" or "Gold Hunters." \n If the Kultajakar are committed to a battle, then the danger to the Undermountain is great and the fight most perilous. Thus, when a member of the Keskainen Vartmerkint says, "We are down to the Kultajakar," they mean that the situation is desperate.
Equipment/&DLC3_Undermountain_Lore_Tale_Title=The Abominable Terror of the Peaks
Equipment/&DLC3_Undermountain_Lore_Tale_Description=A frightening dwarven children's tale of morality.
Equipment/&DLC3_Undermountain_Lore_Tale_Content01=Once upon a time, there were two very naughty children, Hegri and Gurda Blacknose. They were so naughty, they didn't listen to their elders and pulled the beards of old dwarves. \n One day, Hegri and Gurda decided to go on an adventure and leave the village without telling anyone. They packed their rucksacks with snacks, and filled their drinking skins with small beer. Oh, what naughty children they were!\n It started to snow heavily, and the children were soon lost. Noises and shapes followed them.
Equipment/&DLC3_Undermountain_Lore_Tale_Content02=If Hegri and Gurda had listened to their parents, then they would have known that being out in a snowstorm was a terrible idea. Because that is when Peak Terrors and Peak Abominations hunt. Huge, awful creatures who love nothing more than eating a naughty dwarven child for their dinner. \n Hegri and Gurda screamed, as hurtling out of the Great White came monsters with white fur and gnashing teeth. Dropping their rucksacks, they ran, but it was too late!\nPoor Hegri and Gurda were never seen again.\n The End
Equipment/&DLC3_ElvenSettlements_Lore_TheSchism_Title=The Schism
Equipment/&DLC3_ElvenSettlements_Lore_TheSchism_Description=An exploration of the true origins of the sylvan elves.
Equipment/&DLC3_ElvenSettlements_Lore_TheSchism_Content01=If the histories of the Manacalon Empire are true, and without fault, then all elves in the most ancient of times were once high elves, without exception. It is said it was the foundation of the Manacalon Empire and their strict and brutal imposition of order on all elves that brought about the change that begat the sylvan elves. The tone and inconsistency in the details of such histories does, however, leave much room for doubt, as does the earliest oral histories of the Coedymwarth.
Equipment/&DLC3_ElvenSettlements_Lore_TheSchism_Content02=It is the comparative lack of written accounts from the earliest days of the Coedymwarth rebellion, and the remarkably "on message" surviving accounts written by the high elves that makes any determination of the exact truth so difficult. Among the most ancient of the oral histories, the sylvan elves often talk of having been "borne from the Woodes and Wealdes of the Worlde." And yet the Manacalon Empire universally dismisses such claims as "most false and without merit."
Equipment/&DLC3_ElvenSettlements_Lore_TheSchism_Content03=Why such dogmatic insistence by the Manacalon Empire and the high elves, the former masters? Why are sylvan elves so recognizably culturally distinct in their mindset and their society? Why are the sylvan elves so unlike the many other high elves who also rebelled and left the Empire at the same time as the sylvan elves of the Coedymwarth? Thus, the time of separation between the two does not sufficiently explain this divergence.
Equipment/&DLC3_ElvenSettlements_Lore_TheSchism_Content04=Could the divergence of elvenkind have begun long before the Coedymwarth? Is there a germ of truth in the idea that the affinity for wood and woodland living had already created a fundamental separation among elvenkind? The similarity between the two branches says that a common ancestry is true, but that does not mean the high elves were first. Could that be the reason for the Coedymwarth rebellion? The high elves imposing their version of the truth on their cousins as well as all other species?
Equipment/&DLC3_ElvenSettlements_Lore_Dragons_Title=Notes on a New Bloodline
Equipment/&DLC3_ElvenSettlements_Lore_Dragons_Description=A scrap from a draconic diary talking of the dragonborn.
Equipment/&DLC3_ElvenSettlements_Lore_Dragons_Content01=Tanan, 25th day.\n The last two centuries have been hard. The works I have spent so much effort to create have all failed to bear fruit. So it is with joy, and some astonishment, that I have found myself with child by my lover, Lutharion… \n \n Tandwyn, 16th day.\n Our joy has turned to shock. The child, she is a dragonborn! How is this possible? Lutharion has no dragon blood. I was assured by Cleira that this couldn't happen. But it has. Beautiful as she is, Dorcas is no elf. Still, my love cares not…
Equipment/&DLC3_ElvenSettlements_Lore_Dragons_Content02=Aeardair, 8th day.\n I have gone into hiding with Dorcas. Too many react in a way that pierces my heart. She grows fast. Unlike her father, her limbs are powerful and her scales beautiful and dark, shining like obsidian. But she has no look of an elf, other than her bipedal form…
Equipment/&DLC3_ElvenSettlements_Lore_Dragons_Content03=Many pages are water-soaked, the ink has bled through the pages, and many have stuck together.
Equipment/&DLC3_ElvenSettlements_Lore_Dragons_Content04=Isgeun, 12th day. \n Dorcas, faithful to a fault, is invaluable, reinvigorating me, instrumental in my escape from those who chase us from each home. We flee ever north, hoping to find others like ourselves.\n How could I know how important my dear dragonborn would become in the dark days that have come, fleeing ever northwards, always seeking safety, now in disguised refuge among the clans of the Snow Alliance. Maybe here we shall know some peace, among folk more accepting of difference…

Equipment/&DLC3_ElvenSettlements_Lore_DayliLife_Description=Parchment letter from before the Cataclysm.
Equipment/&DLC3_ElvenSettlements_Lore_DayliLife_Content01=Dearest Edfalyad,\n How is your lovely partner Lythyrial? Have you found a place for your new loom yet? \n Forgive me, I suppose I really should come to the point of my writing this letter. \n Today we decided that the dark disease they call the Manacalon Empire has been getting too close. Colthannin has become crowded with refugees, and my dearest Khaly's soul wearies at the constant influx of strangers always talking of war. It is for this reason I have arranged for us to travel north…
Equipment/&DLC3_ElvenSettlements_Lore_DayliLife_Content02=…to a land where our people and snow dwarves are said to meet as equals, a place of unrivaled, stark beauty, freedom, and opportunity. \n The people of this land call themselves the Snow Alliance, and our people have a place there, I think it is called Lantinen. \n If it doesn't work out? Well, we can always come back to Dunannon through the Sylvan Step gates.\n Sorry to be so brief, but my heart aches to leave you both here.\n Yours with love,\nMiruthdrel Lightsong

Equipment/&DLC3_Gallivan_Lore_ThreeCenturyPact_Description=The Wars before the Three Century Pact.
Equipment/&DLC3_Gallivan_Lore_ThreeCenturyPact_Content01=This ancient and crumbling tome appears to be centuries old. Many pages crumble to dust on contact or have faded beyond legibility.
Equipment/&DLC3_Gallivan_Lore_ThreeCenturyPact_Content02=To comprehend the Three Century Pact and its benefits for the Eastern Kingdoms, it is important to understand the almost constant state of internecine and national wars that preceded it. In this tome, I will attempt to discuss the why, the who, and the where - and sometimes the how.\nFirst, we need to know the major players in this series of conflicts: \nThe Principality of Masgarth, the Kingdom of Gallivan, the New Empire, the Snow Alliance, and the Kingdom of Colthannin.
Equipment/&DLC3_Gallivan_Lore_ThreeCenturyPact_Content03=After the Cataclysm, the world was in chaos and bereft of mana, and few could see a time when there would be any normality. It was this event that led to the rise the major powers that we see today. Each of the previously mentioned states vying to carve a niche for the survival of their people, soon bringing them into conflict with each other. \nIt was during this conflict that Masgarth lost three of its nine duchies, but unified into a Principality under the reign of Galoreth Silverflower, and…
Equipment/&DLC3_Gallivan_Lore_ThreeCenturyPact_Content04=the borders of Colthannin and Gallivan settled on the island of Rivermeet. \nIt was in the formulation of this same pact that the territorial integrity of the Snow Alliance was finally recognized, and the New Empire undertook to cease its attempts at wars of conquest to its north and east. \nAlthough it is tempting to see these borders as being the natural state of affairs, the truth is that they fluctuated significantly in the preceding centuries of conflict, with…

Equipment/&DLC3_Document_Clue_ElvenSettlements_03_Description=A document containing notes from the guard captain Elora Brightheart.
Equipment/&DLC3_Document_Clue_ElvenSettlements_03_Content=It has been reported to my attention that two of your volunteers seem not to take their duty seriously. One is a notorious customer of the Auld Cedar, a woman, and the other has been reported to be inattentive and often missing hours, in spite of regulations. I know these elves are not professional soldiers, but those who swear to protect the citizens of the settlement must be worthy of their oath, otherwise, they should return to their civilian activities.\nCaptain Brightheart

Equipment/&DLC3_Gallivan_Clue_Item_05_Description=Handwritten notes from General Blunt.
Equipment/&DLC3_Gallivan_Clue_Item_05_Content=Notes for Captain Ashdown regarding the officers under his supervision.\nLieutenant Denila Highspirit: I know the Einareum had her briefly imprisoned and interrogated, but they cleared her. I think she's simply ambitious and arrogant. Nevertheless, she is a talented and efficient soldier. However, she should be leading her own company instead of jostling with competitors, especially when we need unity above all else.\n Second Lieutenant Zarmir Ortus is a wildcard. Great fighter, but unreliable. He's a drinker, a hedonist, and not a soldier at heart. Let's just say he's good for the battlefield but bad for bootcamp.\n Lord Synatir is both soft and arrogant, he likely earned his rank through nepotism.\n Warrant Officer Jaden Greyhouse: He's soft, his head is back home with his fiancée, not focused here on the front.\n Lance Corporal Hillsborough: So far unremarkable. Let's hope she's worth something.

How can we give nobility titles to monsters??!\n Ortus: A disgusting, horned tiefling… he was in a brothel yesterday, and I saw him returning to the dormitory completely drunk, three times. I've heard rumors of demons. Why can't anyone else see that he matches the description??!\n Highspirit: Another long-eared harlot, power-hungry. Who the heck does she think she is??

Equipment/&DLC3_Telema_Lore_AbyssalAgitator_Title=Notes on an Abyssal Agitator by Exonaïka
Equipment/&DLC3_Telema_Lore_AbyssalAgitator_Description=A description of how to construct and operate an Abyssal Agitator, written in elvish.
Equipment/&DLC3_Telema_Lore_AbyssalAgitator_Content01=An unintended boon discovered in my myriad battles with the demon-kind has been that the essences of their spirit and mana are often left behind as a residue. This essence takes the form of a foul and viscous substance when the host is killed.\n After much experimentation, I have been able to create a variety of worthy and useful unguents wrought from foul origins. Useful - if the user can put up with the noxious fumes generated by their application.
Equipment/&DLC3_Telema_Lore_AbyssalAgitator_Content02=To achieve creation of the necessary mixing device, which I now call an "Abyssal Agitator," carefully follow my instructions herein. It is but a simple matter to assemble using a crafting tool, if you know how. \n Once the Abyssal Agitator is complete, it is possible to begin the mixing of the indicated ingredients to create a variety of applications. I have decided to call these substances "demonic grease." \n Please refer to the appended list of recipes that I have included herein.
Equipment/&DLC3_WhiteCity_Lore_Gnomes_Title=Gnomes
Equipment/&DLC3_WhiteCity_Lore_Gnomes_Description=Some observations from Antiquarians.
Equipment/&DLC3_WhiteCity_Lore_Gnomes_Content01=There is much mystery to the origins of gnomes. Which stories are to be believed is a question oft debated since they first emerged above ground after the Cataclysm. Are they a native species to Solasta, or did they come through the Rift? Did they exist on Ferendragh at the dawn of Solasta's history? Are they a magically created species, or their own unique people? \n Who truly knows? The gnomes themselves are always evasive on the subject when pressed too hard by outsiders.
Equipment/&DLC3_WhiteCity_Lore_Gnomes_Content02=Among many common tales gnomes have been heard to tell others, the most common include: \n "We dug our way here from a world underneath Solasta and caused the Rift. So we hid to avoid taking the blame."\n "We created a time travel machine which exploded, and we lost all our memories and language. The dwarves and halflings taught us to read and write again." \n "Millennia ago, deep under Ferendragh, strange beings ate strange mushrooms. Out of this quite unique diet came the gnomes."
Equipment/&DLC3_WhiteCity_Lore_Gnomes_Content03=Whatever the truth may be, we do know that gnomes are not as tall as halflings nor as tall or as broad as dwarves. Their quite unique tongue appears to have many words with roots in ancient dwarven, and uses dwarven runes when written. They are well-suited to living under ground, being able to see well in poor light. They are often reclusive, smart, and have an amazing talent for tinkering, a knack for cunning and humor, and a flexible approach to honor and morality.
Equipment/&DLC3_WhiteCity_Lore_Tieflings_Title=Tieflings: Demonspawn or Misunderstood?
Equipment/&DLC3_WhiteCity_Lore_Tieflings_Description=Brief Antiquarian notes on the infernal spawn.
Equipment/&DLC3_WhiteCity_Lore_Tieflings_Content01=After much research, it is now known that tieflings are not, as had previously been rumored, from the Western Kingdoms or from another continent. After much effort and at great expense, we finally managed to get a group of tieflings to agree to be interviewed. How much of what they said is true is up for debate. Until we can unearth more evidence, the following is as good as we can get:\n The first tieflings were from Tirmar, and they entered Solasta through the Rift.
Equipment/&DLC3_WhiteCity_Lore_Tieflings_Content02=They were enemies of the Sorr-Akkath even before they entered Solasta. Their legends speak of an infernal curse on the peoples, family, and descendants of a Priest of Pakri, named Eikon.\n Eikon's bargain with a devil-prince had been made in order to save their kingdom and to also be immune to the control of Soraks, but that bargain came at a terrible price, an infernal taint, a curse that produced the tieflings. The bargain failed to save their kingdom, forcing them to flee through the Rift.
Equipment/&DLC3_WhiteCity_Lore_Tieflings_Content03=In the centuries since the Cataclysm and the closing of the Rift, the tieflings have had to live in hard-to-reach places, hiding in the darkest dens beneath cities, and in wild, out-of-the-way places. Always outsiders, treated with great suspicion by native Solastans and humans alike. Some say that lack of faith is deserved, and that no creature that has an infernal taint can be fully trusted. We shall let the reader decide the truth of that.
Equipment/&DLC3_WhiteCity_Lore_Eulalia_Title=The Eulalia
Equipment/&DLC3_WhiteCity_Lore_Eulalia_Description=A brief account of its history and construction.
Equipment/&DLC3_WhiteCity_Lore_Eulalia_Content01=The Eulalia, more commonly known as the "Song Speaker of White Rock City," was first built in the third century after the Cataclysm by the legendary dwarven smith Storri Brighthearth, and his friend, the elven bard Veralia Lyralyn. \n The Eulalia was intended not only to create a visually appealing focal point for the city, but also as an instrument that could be used as a means of weather prediction, emergency alarm, citywide communication, and occasional entertainment for the city's citizens.
Equipment/&DLC3_WhiteCity_Lore_Eulalia_Content02=When correctly played by trained operators, the Eulalia has multiple uses, and can create a variety of warning siren notes to alert the city and its defenders to imminent dangers to the city. It can also call out prearranged signals that can be heard throughout the city and its caverns, and thus coordinates the city in times of emergency. On feast days and special occasions, the Eulalia can also be played by skilled bards to create beautiful and rousing music that entertains the city.
Equipment/&DLC3_WhiteCity_Lore_Eulalia_Content03=When not used as an instrument in this way, the air ducts that feed to it from the outside naturally respond audibly to changes in airflow and air pressure, and thus create a harmonic and accurate barometer of the prevailing weather conditions outside the city, as well as an alert for changes of air quality in the deep mines and caverns below.
Equipment/&DLC3_WhiteCity_Lore_KeskainenVartmerkint_Title=The Keskainen Vartmerkint
Equipment/&DLC3_WhiteCity_Lore_KeskainenVartmerkint_Description=A book about the peoples of the Undermountain.
Equipment/&DLC3_WhiteCity_Lore_KeskainenVartmerkint_Content01=Rock and furnace, vein and ore. The people of the Undermountain are the foundation on which the Snow Alliance is built. Dwarves true of purpose and strong of arm. The unseen bulwark against the tides of evil that besiege the Snow Alliance. Our metal ores fuel the forges that create our wealth, and the armor and weapons we use to fight. The rocks we quarry maintain and build the walls that protect the nation. Without the Keskainen Vartmerkint, the Snow Alliance would collapse.
Equipment/&DLC3_WhiteCity_Lore_KeskainenVartmerkint_Content02=Outsiders say that we deep dwarves should open up to the world, but what do outsiders know of our ways or of our people? We are the anvil of dwarven creation! \n Find here our list of those most honored. Names to be carved on the Stone Tablets for all eternity:\n Brokir Steelheart, Leader of House Perlevinn, Chieftain of the Steelheart Clan. Wise and stout of heart.\n Baldi Boldhand, Leader of House Ettiven, Chieftain of the Boldhand Clan. Brave and bold in nature and in name.
Equipment/&DLC3_WhiteCity_Lore_KeskainenVartmerkint_Content03=Gunna Wisehead, Electoral Overseer of the Keskainen. Honest and true to the clans of the Undermountain.\n Hakki Strongspine, famed Kultajakar who slaughtered two Peak Terrors with just two sweeps of his axe.\n Magda Strongstone, honored representative of Turvaamalinn to White Rock City.
Equipment/&DLC3_Gallivan_Lore_CourtOfKnives_Title=The Court of Knives
Equipment/&DLC3_Gallivan_Lore_CourtOfKnives_Description=A journal describing political intrigues in Gallivan.
Equipment/&DLC3_Gallivan_Lore_CourtOfKnives_Content01=Dearest brother,\n As you know, a war with the Snow Alliance grows ever more likely, and the continuing paranoia and intrigues at court grow ever more bizarre. For my safety, I write this journal in the hope that I might get it to you without detection.\n Jornalas is becoming ever more erratic. It is as though he is a different man. His raging outbursts now silence any who offer an opinion or advice on any matter. His new advisors support him in this and surround him, controlling access to his presence.
Equipment/&DLC3_Gallivan_Lore_CourtOfKnives_Content02=Queen Lucilla and her entourage have not been seen at court for weeks, and are said to be ensconced in the Royal Apartments outside the city. None are allowed to communicate directly to her, and the families of her entourage are nowhere to be found. \n Meanwhile, Edwor Strongheart has vanished after another vocal confrontation with his father. Officially, Edwor has gone "to survey troop deployments" in the deep forests to the east, "in order to counter a possible threat from Colthannin."
Equipment/&DLC3_Gallivan_Lore_CourtOfKnives_Content03=After another one of his increasingly common confrontations with the King's advisors, Lord Bryden Sledge was dragged away in disgrace. Allegedly, he was plotting to sell out the kingdom to the Soraks. Any who know Bryden know that although money is a strong motivator, his immense wealth and family ties precludes the possibility of him wanting to sell us out in such a way. He is currently held in the castle dungeons, and King Jornalas refuses to let anyone speak to him.
Equipment/&DLC3_Gallivan_Lore_CourtOfKnives_Content04=I must end this journal here and send it with my trusted batman Sturges. I have been told to prepare for a visit by the King's retinue, and must entertain them. They arrive soon. I hope they do not suspect me of anything.\n With abiding affection, your true and loyal brother,\n R.
Equipment/&DLC3_Gallivan_Lore_GallivanOnTheMarch_Title=Gallivan on the March
Equipment/&DLC3_Gallivan_Lore_GallivanOnTheMarch_Description=A letter in response to the intrigues at court.
Equipment/&DLC3_Gallivan_Lore_GallivanOnTheMarch_Content01=My brother,\n I hope this letter will find you both well and whole. It is with great distress that I read of the goings-on at court. Perhaps desperate times call for desperate measures?\n I too feel it is only a matter of time before the horns of war are blown to the borders here in the north. Although I have at no point found any solid evidence of the Snow Alliance seeking to make incursions on our own lands borders, I have seen military activity on the Snow Alliance side.
Equipment/&DLC3_Gallivan_Lore_GallivanOnTheMarch_Content02=This activity suggests that maybe the Snow Alliance is preparing for a war. \n We must remember that dwarves and elves are creatures unlike humans, creatures that we cannot fully trust. They see this world and humans differently. Living as long as they do makes them unable to understand who we are, or why we do what we do. This may be why the King acts as he does. Perhaps he is in possession of secret knowledge we cannot fathom. Perhaps the Soraks have infiltrated the Snow Alliance.
Equipment/&DLC3_Gallivan_Lore_GallivanOnTheMarch_Content03=Whatever the truth, I have sworn an eternal oath of duty to the Kingdom of Gallivan, and as such, to its true and rightful king. I am already commanded with raising troops, equipment, and supplies "for actions to repel Snow Alliance aggression." Such actions worry me, but I cannot shirk my duty. We march for the borders and commence construction of watchtowers and fortifications at the soonest instance.\n Your true and loyal brother,\n F.

Equipment/&DLC3_WhiteCity_Lore_TrappersFamily_Description=A note written by Helga Strongbow.
Equipment/&DLC3_WhiteCity_Lore_TrappersFamily_Content01=My dear friends,\n \n I cannot thank you enough for saving me and my son from certain death. I grieve every moment for Snorri, and I know he would be grateful for what you did for our family.\n I am sure you would have gotten along with him.\n \n Please accept this as a token of my gratitude. We fished it out a few days ago, but I have a strong feeling that this will be more useful to you than to me.\n May our paths cross again one day.\n \n Helga
Equipment/&DLC3_WhiteCity_Lore_GeneralBlunt_Title=Letter from General Blunt
Equipment/&DLC3_WhiteCity_Lore_GeneralBlunt_Description=A note written by General Blunt.
Equipment/&DLC3_WhiteCity_Lore_GeneralBlunt_Content01=Thank you again for your help. I knew I could trust you. You made the right choice. Our army cannot afford to host traitors.\n \n Take this as a token of my appreciation. It is a piece of armor that I recovered from the corpse of a Gallivan general a few weeks ago, but I didn't really know what to do with it.\n I hope it will be useful to you in your quest.\n \n General Blunt
Equipment/&DLC3_WhiteCity_Lore_CaptainAshdown_Title=Letter from Captain Ashdown
Equipment/&DLC3_WhiteCity_Lore_CaptainAshdown_Description=A note written by Captain Ashdown.
Equipment/&DLC3_WhiteCity_Lore_CaptainAshdown_Content01=Thank you again for your help. I knew I could trust you. You made the right choice. Our army really needed a renewal if we ever want to win this war.\n\n Take this as a token of my appreciation. It is a piece of armor that I recovered from the corpse of a Gallivan general a few weeks ago, but I didn't really know what to do with it.\n I hope it will be useful to you in your quest.\n \n Captain Ashdown
Equipment/&DLC3_Document_BericLetter_Title=Letter from Marshal Beric Sunblaze
Equipment/&DLC3_Document_BericLetter_Description=As promised, you and Marshal Sunblaze exchange letters to keep informed of the situation in the Snow Alliance and in the Principality. Somehow, his letters always seem to find you.
Equipment/&DLC3_Document_BericLetter_Content01=Dear friends, I heard about the tragic events at Kaupaapunki. I am glad, though, that you were able to find Lord Kaikonnen's murderer and cleanse the city of Sorak infiltrators. It confirms that our enemy is also deeply established in the Snow Alliance. News from the front is not good: the forces of the Principality are barely sustaining the advance of Gallivan troops.
Equipment/&DLC3_Document_BericLetter_Content01b=On the upside, the New Empire is not using the opportunity to attack from the south. Even they are not blind enough to help the Sorr-Akkath destroy us. I wish you the best in your endeavors. Marshal Beric Sunblaze
Equipment/&DLC3_Document_BericLetter_Content01c=On the upside, the New Empire is not using the opportunity to attack from the south. Even they are not blind enough to help the Sorr-Akkath destroy us. I wish you the best in your endeavors. Marshal Beric Sunblaze
Equipment/&DLC3_Document_BericLetter_Content02=Dear friends, I was surprised to hear from Master Goodcheer on your behalf. She told me you were tracking demons, which is a worrying prospect. The thought that Sorr-Akkath and demons could be working together keeps me up at night. On the bright side, the troops of the Principality won a decisive battle on the front.
Equipment/&DLC3_Document_BericLetter_Content02b=I'm afraid this might push our enemy to move its troops northwards and cause more trouble for the Snow Alliance. Good luck with your research. Marshal Beric Sunblaze
Equipment/&DLC3_Document_BericLetter_Content03=Dear friends, I received word from Commander Miles at Highrock Outpost. He tells me you unraveled a Sorak network that linked a scavenger quartermaster named Hector to an infiltrator among his men.
Equipment/&DLC3_Document_BericLetter_Content03b=That means that despite their massive attack against Caer Cyflen, the Sorr-Akkath still have sleeping agents all over the Eastern Kingdoms.
Equipment/&DLC3_Document_BericLetter_Content03c=Keep up the good work. Every operation that we reveal is another blow to their evil plans. \n Einar guide you!\n \n Marshal Beric Sunblaze
Equipment/&DLC3_Document_BericLetter_Content04=Dear friends, I received word of the events on the frontline between Gallivan and the Snow Alliance. I met with General Blunt but not with Captain Ashdown. I'm sorry things had to turn the way they did, but I trust your make the right choice. What matters is that you obtained the support of the Itainen Vartmerkint.
Equipment/&DLC3_Document_BericLetter_Content04b=I'm also glad of all the damage you dealt to the Sorr-Akkath pawns in the armies of Gallivan. \n We still have strong suspicions that the royal family there has been replaced, and no idea of where the real King, Jornalas IV, is being held prisoner. \n Stay in the light! Marshal Beric Sunblaze
Equipment/&DLC3_Document_BericLetter_Content05=Dear friends, I heard about your adventures in the elven settlements of the Snow Alliance. \n Again, you found Soraks infiltrating influential people, with elaborated plots to manipulate our allies. \n I do hope your investigations into the demon threat is progressing well.
Equipment/&DLC3_Document_BericLetter_Content05b=On our side, we had a military drawback in the south: a company of mercenaries hit our troops by surprise, but this does reveal that Gallivan is having difficulties mustering more of their own. \n \n We lost a battle, not the war. Stay in the light! Marshal Beric Sunblaze
Equipment/&DLC3_Document_BericLetter_Content06=Dear friends, our common friend Galar Goldentongue informed me of the events in Turvaamalinn. Once again, you prevented the Sorr-Akkath from meddling in the internal politics of the Snow Alliance. The troops of the Principality earned a great victory on the frontline recently when a company of Spellblades, led by Lord Danantar himself, unleashed havoc on a strategic location on the border.
Equipment/&DLC3_Document_BericLetter_Content06b=Some of the officers were Sorr-Akkath infiltrators, you won't be surprised to hear. Continue the good work. Einar guide you.\n \n Marshal Beric Sunblaze
Equipment/&DLC3_Document_BericLetter_Content07=Dear friends, I received word that you have traveled to the far north of the Alliance with my old friend Marduk Strongheart. Yes, he became a Paladin of Einar the same year I did, and we used to be close. \n \n Knowing him, I suppose this was an adventurous expedition, and I'm glad you were with him. I hope his clan recovers from the tragic events that have befallen them.
Equipment/&DLC3_Document_BericLetter_Content07b=On the bright side, I have news that you'll be happy to hear: our common acquaintance, Lord Faisech, has requested diplomatic immunity. \n He isn't a Sorr-Akkath in disguise, but as I thought, simply a despicable human being. \n \n Good luck, and stay in the light. Marshal Beric Sunblaze
Equipment/&DLC3_Document_BericLetter_Content08=Dear friends, Master Gorm sent me a message explaining your situation. \nWhat you're about to accomplish is even more dreadful than taking a Major Gate to the Aer Elai. \n I know little of demons, but enough to recommend that you arm yourselves with weapons other than those that use fire or cold, and to protect yourselves against those elements, as they as the favorites of this Sessroth and his goons.
Equipment/&DLC3_Document_BericLetter_Content08b=Also remember that demons cannot die unless killed on their own plane of existence. \n \n I hope you find a way to stop this threat once and for all. Einar guide you. Marshal Beric Sunblaze
