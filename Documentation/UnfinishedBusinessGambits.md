If used on an enemy, they must pass a Dexterity saving throw or switch places with you and be unable to make opportunity attacks until the end of your turn.

# 19. - Tactical Strike

You can forgo one of your main action attacks to instruct an ally to strike. When you do so, expend one gambit die, choose an ally (other than yourself) and an enemy.
