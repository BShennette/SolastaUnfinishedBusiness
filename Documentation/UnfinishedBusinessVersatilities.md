# 1. - Battlefield Conversion [Int]

Cost: Minimum of twice your pact magic slot level and pool size points, half refunded on failure.
In combat, if you have expended any pact magic slots, you can use a bonus action to make an Intelligence (Arcana) check with a DC of 8 + your proficiency bonus. If you succeed, you regain one pact magic slot. Then depending on success/failure, the DC of this ability increases/decreases by your pact magic slot level (no lower than initial DC). The DC resets after a long rest.

# 2. - Battlefield Shorthand [Int]

Cost: None.
When an ally or an enemy within your sight and 60 feet casts a spell that can be identified, and you have high enough Warlock spellcasting level to cast it, you make an Intelligence (Arcana) check with a DC of 15 + twice the spell's level. You can reduce the DC by 1 for each Eldritch Point you have, but not lower than 15 + the spell's level. If you succeed, you add the spell to your Warlock spellbook. Once you cast it, or after a long rest, the added spell gets removed.

# 3. - Blast Breakthrough [Str]

Cost: 1 point per beam.
Depending on your Strength modifier, you Eldritch Blast gain the following benefits:
At least 1: Add your Strength modifier to Attack roll.
At least 2: Ignore disadvantage when you are within 5 feet of a hostile creature.
At least 3: Ignore all damage resistances of the targets.
At least 4: Ignore all damage immunities of the targets.
At least 5: Ignore all spell immunities of the targets.

# 4. - Blast Empower [Str]

Cost: 1 point per beam.
You add your Strength modifier to the damage to your Eldritch Blast.

# 5. - Eldritch Aegis [Wis]

Cost: 1 point per AC bonus.
Within 30 feet, including you, a friendly creature within your sight that is about to be hit by an attack can benefit from your reaction. You grant it an AC bonus until next turn start, so that they are just missed by the attack, and you automatically spend extra points to increase the bonus to avoid subsequent hits. The maximum bonus you can grant is equal to your Wisdom modifier.

# 6. - Eldritch Ward [Wis]

Cost: 1 point per saving throw bonus.
Within 30 feet, including you, all friendly creatures within your sight that are about to fail a saving throw can benefit from your reaction. You grant them a bonus to their saving throw until they just succeed on it. The maximum bonus you can grant is equal to your Wisdom modifier.
